## Theatre of social inclusion of V4 citizens and Ukraine refugees

### (Part 1: Human caravan V4)

Something unknown lies **ahead**. 

A war is burning **near us**. 

Suddenly, a stranger lives **next to us**. Another. 

A barrier stands **between us** – a thick layer of ice. Can it be melted? 

Will we leave our prejudices **behind** and melt the frozen rivers together?

Will we meet each other **upstream**?

ICEBREAKING is **uncovering** the stereotypes in our heads. 

**Breaking down** the boxes we pigeonhole people into – immediately, but forever.

**Breaking through** the prejudices of our day. 

**Bonding with** those we need to survive.
