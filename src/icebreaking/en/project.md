# {{ title }}

Four partners to produce a street performance act focusing on closing the distance between V4 citizens and Ukrainian refugees. ICEBREAKING will be an original physical-visual expression of social inclusion that tells stories of people living in mixed communities through theatre. A theatre that breaks down the prejudices, portrays the benefits of global coexistence and gets people closer together.
